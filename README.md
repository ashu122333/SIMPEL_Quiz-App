# Quiz App for Professors and Students

This is a simple quiz web application built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows professors to add quiz questions and students to take the quiz. Students can only take the quiz once, and their scores are stored locally.

## Features

- **Professor Page**: Professors can add quiz questions with multiple choice answers.
- **Student Page**: Students can attempt the quiz and submit their answers. Once submitted, their scores are recorded, and they cannot retake the quiz.
- **Local Storage**: Quiz questions and student scores are saved in the browser's local storage.
- **Score Display**: Professors can view the scores of all students who have attempted the quiz.
